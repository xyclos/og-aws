#VPCs, Network Security, and Security Groups
-------------------------------------------

### VPC Basics

-	üìí [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) ‚àô [User guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide) ‚àô [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/) ‚àô [Security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html) ‚àô [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/)
-	**VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud) is the virtualized networking layer of your AWS systems.
-	Most AWS users should have a basic understanding of VPC concepts, but few need to get into all the details. VPC configurations can be trivial or extremely complex, depending on the extent of your network and security needs.
-	All modern AWS accounts (those created [after 2013-12-04](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html)) are ‚ÄúEC2-VPC‚Äù accounts that support VPCs, and all instances will be in a default VPC. Older accounts may still be using ‚ÄúEC2-Classic‚Äù mode. Some features don‚Äôt work without VPCs, so you probably will want to [migrate](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-migrate.html).

### VPC and Network Security Tips

-	‚ùó**Security groups** are your first line of defense for your servers. Be extremely restrictive of what ports are open to all incoming connections. In general, if you use CLBs, ALBs or other load balancing, the only ports that need to be open to incoming traffic would be port 22 and whatever port your application uses.
-	**Port hygiene:** A good habit is to pick unique ports within an unusual range for each different kind of production service. For example, your web fronted might use 3010, your backend services 3020 and 3021, and your Postgres instances the usual 5432. Then make sure you have fine-grained security groups for each set of servers. This makes you disciplined about listing out your services, but also is more error-proof. For example, should you accidentally have an extra Apache server running on the default port 80 on a backend server, it will not be exposed.
-	**Migrating from Classic**: For migrating from older EC2-Classic deployments to modern EC2-VPC setup, [this article](http://blog.kiip.me/engineering/ec2-to-vpc-executing-a-zero-downtime-migration/) may be of help.
-	For basic AWS use, one default VPC may be sufficient. But as you scale up, you should consider mapping out network topology more thoroughly. A good overview of best practices is [here](http://blog.flux7.com/blogs/aws/vpc-best-configuration-practices).
-	Consider controlling access to your private AWS resources through a [VPN](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpn-connections.html).
	-	You get better visibility into and control of connection and connection attempts.
	-	You expose a smaller surface area for attack compared to exposing separate (potentially authenticated) services over the public internet.
		-	e.g. A bug in the YAML parser used by the Ruby on Rails admin site is much less serious when the admin site is only visible to the private network and accessed through VPN.
	-	Another common pattern (especially as deployments get larger, security or regulatory requirements get more stringent, or team sizes increase) is to provide a [bastion host](https://www.pandastrike.com/posts/20141113-bastion-hosts) behind a VPN through which all SSH connections need to transit.

### VPC and Network Security Gotchas and Limitations

-	üî∏Security groups are not shared across data centers, so if you have infrastructure in multiple data centers, you should make sure your configuration/deployment tools take that into account.
-	‚ùóBe careful when choosing your VPC IP CIDR block: If you are going to need to make use of [ClassicLink](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-classiclink.html), make sure that your private IP range [doesn‚Äôt overlap](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-classiclink.html#classiclink-limitations) with that of EC2 Classic.
-	‚ùóIf you are going to peer VPCs, carefully consider the cost of of [data transfer between VPCs](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#Peering_Connections), since for some workloads and integrations, this can be prohibitively expensive.
