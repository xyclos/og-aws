### ALB Basics

-	üìí [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/) ‚àô [User guide](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/developer-resources/) ‚àô [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/faqs/) ‚àô [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/pricing/)
-	üê•**Websockets and HTTP/2** are [now supported](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-application-load-balancer/).
-	Prior to the Application Load Balancer, you were advised to use TCP instead of HTTP as the protocol to make it work (as described [here](http://www.quora.com/When-will-Amazon-ELB-offer-SPDY-support)) and use [the obscure but useful Proxy Protocol](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/enable-proxy-protocol.html) ([more on this](https://chrislea.com/2014/03/20/using-proxy-protocol-nginx/)) to pass client IPs over a TCP load balancer.

### ALB Tips

-	Use ALBs to route to services that are hosted on shared clusters with dynamic port assignment (like ECS or Mesos).
-	ALBs support HTTP path-based routing (send HTTP requests for ‚Äú/api/*‚Äù -> {target-group-1}, ‚Äú/blog/*‚Äù -> {target group 2}).

### ALB Gotchas and Limitations

-	ALBs support HTTP routing but not port-based TCP routing.
-	ALBs do not (yet) support routing based on HTTP ‚ÄúHost‚Äù header or HTTP verb.
-	Instances in the ALB's target groups have to either have a single, fixed healthcheck port (‚ÄúEC2 instance‚Äù-level healthcheck) or the healthcheck port for a target has to be the same as its application port (‚ÄúApplication instance‚Äù-level healthcheck) - you can't configure a per-target healthcheck port that is different than the application port.
-	ALBs are VPC-only (they are not available in EC2 Classic)
-	In a target group, if there is no healthy target, all requests are routed to all targets. For example, if you point a listener at a target group containing a single service that has a long initialization phase (during which the health checks would fail), requests will reach the service while it is still starting up.
