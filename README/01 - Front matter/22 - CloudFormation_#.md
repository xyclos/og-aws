### CloudFormation Basics

-	ðŸ“’ [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) âˆ™ [Developer guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/) âˆ™ [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/faqs/) âˆ™ [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/pricing/) at no additional charge
-	**CloudFormation** offers mechanisms to create and manage entire configurations of many types of AWS resources, using a JSON-based templating language.
-	ðŸ’¸CloudFormation itself has [no additional charge](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/pricing/) itself; you pay for the underlying resources.

### CloudFormation Alternatives and Lock-In

-	Hashicorpâ€™s [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/vs/cloudformation.html) is a third-party alternative.

### CloudFormation Tips

-	[Troposphere](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere) is a Python library that makes it much easier to create CloudFormation templates.
-	ðŸ”¹Until [2016](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/09/aws-cloudformation-introduces-yaml-template-support-and-cross-stack-references/), CloudFormation used only an awkward JSON format that makes both reading and debugging difficult. To use it effectively typically involved building additional tooling, including converting it to YAML, but now [this is supported directly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-formats.html).

### CloudFormation Gotchas and Limitations

-	ðŸ”¸CloudFormation is useful but complex and with a variety of pain points. Many companies find alternate solutions, and many companies use it, but only with significant additional tooling.
-	ðŸ”¸CloudFormation can be very slow, especially for items like CloudFront distributions.
-	ðŸ”¸Itâ€™s hard to assemble good CloudFormation configurations from existing state. AWS does [offer a trick to do this](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-using-cloudformer.html), but itâ€™s very clumsy.
-	ðŸ”¸Many users donâ€™t use CloudFormation at all because of its limitations, or because they find other solutions preferable. Often there are other ways to accomplish the same goals, such as local scripts (Boto, Bash, Ansible, etc.) you manage yourself that build infrastructure, or Docker-based solutions ([Convox](https://convox.com/), etc.).
