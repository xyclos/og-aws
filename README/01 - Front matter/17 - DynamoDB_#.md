### DynamoDB Basics

-	ðŸ“’ [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) âˆ™ [Developer guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/) âˆ™ [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/faqs/) âˆ™ [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/)
-	**DynamoDB** is a [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database with focuses on speed, flexibility, and scalability.
-	DynamoDB is priced on a combination of throughput and storage.

### DynamoDB Alternatives and Lock-in

-	â›“ Unlike the technologies behind many other Amazon products, DynamoDB is a proprietary AWS product with no interface-compatible alternative available as an open source project. If you tightly couple your application to its API and featureset, it will take significant effort to replace.
-	The most commonly used alternative to DynamoDB is [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/).

### DynamoDB Tips

-	There is a [local version](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/dynamodb-local-for-desktop-development/) of DynamoDB provided for developer use.
-	[DynamoDB Streams](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html) provides an ordered stream of changes to a table. Use it to replicate, back up, or drive events off of data
-	DynamoDB can be used [as a simple locking service](https://gist.github.com/ryandotsmith/c95fd21fab91b0823328).

### DynamoDB Gotchas and Limitations

-	ðŸ”¸ DynamoDB doesnâ€™t provide an easy way to bulk-load data (it is possible through [Data Pipeline](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-importexport-ddb-part1.html), and this has some [unfortunate consequences](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GuidelinesForTables.html#GuidelinesForTables.AvoidExcessivePTIncreases). Since you need to use the regular service APIs to update existing or create new rows, it is common to temporarily turn up a destination tableâ€™s write throughput to speed import. But when the tableâ€™s write capacity is increased, DynamoDB may do an irreversible split of the partitions underlying the table, spreading the total table capacity evenly across the new generation of tables. Later, if the capacity is reduced, the capacity for each partition is also reduced but the total number of partitions is not, leaving less capacity for each partition. This leaves the table in a state where it much easier for hotspots to overwhelm individual partitions.
-	It is important to make sure that DynamoDB [resource limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html#limits-data-types) are compatible with your dataset and workload. For example, the maximum size value that can be added to a DynamoDB table is 400 KB (larger items can be stored in S3 and a URL stored in DynamoDB).
