### Redshift Basics

-	üìí [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) ‚àô [Developer guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/) ‚àô [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/faqs/) ‚àô [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/)
-	**Redshift** is AWS‚Äô managed [data warehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse) solution, which is massively parallel, scalable, and columnar. It is very widely used. It [was built](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Redshift) using [ParAccel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ParAccel) technology and exposes [Postgres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL)-compatible interfaces.

### Redshift Alternatives and Lock-in

-	‚õìüö™Whatever data warehouse you select, your business will likely be locked in for a long time. Also (and not coincidentally) the data warehouse market is highly fragmented. Selecting a data warehouse is a choice to be made carefully, with research and awareness of [the market landscape](https://www.datanami.com/2016/03/14/data-warehouse-market-ripe-disruption-gartner-says/) and what [business intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence) tools you‚Äôll be using.

### Redshift Tips

-	Although Redshift is mostly Postgres-compatible, its SQL dialect and performance profile are different.
-	Redshift supports only [12 primitive data types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_Supported_data_types.html). ([List of unsupported Postgres types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_unsupported-postgresql-datatypes.html)\)
-	It has a leader node and computation nodes (the leader node distributes queries to the computation ones). Note that some functions [can be executed only on the lead node.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_SQL_functions_leader_node_only.html)
-	Major third-party BI tools support Redshift integration (see [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Which-BI-visualisation-solution-goes-best-with-Redshift)).
-	[Top 10 Performance Tuning Techniques for Amazon Redshift](https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/bigdata/post/Tx31034QG0G3ED1/Top-10-Performance-Tuning-Techniques-for-Amazon-Redshift) provides an excellent list of performance tuning techniques.
-	[Amazon Redshift Utils](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-redshift-utils) contains useful utilities, scripts and views to simplify Redshift ops.
-	[VACUUM](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Reclaiming_storage_space202.html) regularly following a significant number of deletes or updates to reclaim space and improve query performance.
-	Redshift provides various [column compression](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Compressing_data_on_disk.html) options to optimize the stored data size. AWS strongly encourages users to use [automatic compression](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_Loading_tables_auto_compress.html) at the COPY stage, when Redshift uses a sample of the data being ingested to analyze the column compression options. However, automatic compression can only be applied to an empty table with no data. Therefore, make sure the initial load batch is big enough to provide Redshift with a representative sample of the data (the default sample size is 100000 rows).

### Redshift Gotchas and Limitations

-	‚ùó‚è±While Redshift can handle heavy queries well, its does not scale horizontally, i.e. does not handle multiple queries in parallel. Therefore, if you expect a high parallel load, consider replicating or (if possible) sharding your data across multiple clusters.
-	üî∏Leader node, which manages communications with client programs and all communication with compute nodes, is the single point of failure.
-	‚è±Although most Redshift queries parallelize well at the compute node level, certain stages are executed on the leader node, which can become the bottleneck.
-	üîπRedshift data commit transactions are very expensive and serialized at the cluster level. Therefore, consider grouping multiple mutation commands (COPY/INSERT/UPDATE) commands into a single transaction whenever possible.
-	üîπRedshift does not support multi-AZ deployments. Building multi-AZ clusters is not trivial. [Here](https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/bigdata/post/Tx13ZDHZANSX9UX/Building-Multi-AZ-or-Multi-Region-Amazon-Redshift-Clusters) is an example using Kinesis.
-	üî∏Beware of storing multiple small tables in Redshift. The way Redshift tables are laid out on disk makes it impractical. The minimum space required to store a table (in MB) is nodes * slices/node * columns. For example, on a 16 node cluster an empty table with 20 columns will occupy 640MB on disk.
-	‚è± Query performance degrades significatly during data ingestion. [WLM (Workload Management)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_workload_mngmt_classification.html) tweaks help to some extent. However, if you need consistent read performance, consider having replica clusters (at the extra cost) and swap them during update.
-	‚ùó Never resize a live cluster. The resize operation takes hours depending on the dataset size. In rare cases, the operation may also get stuck and you'll end up having a non-functional cluster. The safer approach is to create a new cluster from a snapshot, resize the new cluster and shut down the old one.
-	Redshift has reserved keywords which are not present in Postgres (see full list [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_pg_keywords.html)). Watch out for DELTA ([Delta Encodings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_Delta_encoding.html)).
-	Redshift does not support many Postgres functions, most notably several date/time-related and aggregation functions. See the [full list here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_unsupported-postgresql-functions.html).
