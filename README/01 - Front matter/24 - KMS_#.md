-	ðŸ“’ [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) âˆ™ [Developer guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/) âˆ™ [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/faqs/) âˆ™ [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/)
-	**KMS** (Key Management Service) is secure service for storing keys, such encryption keys for [EBS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) and [S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html).

### KMS Tips

-	ðŸ”¹Itâ€™s very common for companies to manage keys completely via home-grown mechanisms, but itâ€™s far preferable to use a service such as KMS from the beginning, as it encourages more secure design and improves policies and processes around managing keys.
-	A good motivation and overview is in [this AWS presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/encryption-and-key-management-in-aws).
-	The cryptographic details are in [this AWS whitepaper](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/KMS-Cryptographic-Details.pdf).
